# I Find It Quite Simple
Complex? Doom?

## Guiding Principles
- Everything should interact in some way with everything else.
- Yes, And. Everything should be goofy, but everything should empower the player.
- Give the player ALL the numbers.
- Scaling, scaling, scaling.

## Universal Mechanics
- Level: Everything has a Level. Outgoing damage is multiplied by `ATK/100`, then raised to the power of a random value between 1 and `(AIM/100)`. Incoming damage is divided by `DEF/100`. Defense is *halved* on attacks that hit from behind (defined as the Source being within the 90 degree cone immediately behind the monster, 135 to 225)
- Player starts with 100 in all 3 stats and gains 1 in a random stat per level (you level up really fast). Monsters have a level based on the average player level, randomized by up to 20% down or 40% up; they start with 50 in all stats and gain up to 2 points per level
- Miami Reload: Weapons dropped on the ground cannot be picked up if you already own a weapon of that type. Drop your current gun, though, and you can pick up another one with a full mag. Weapons will spawn a little ammo nearby as a treat.
- Dead stuff drops score items based on that stuff's health. You can buy random DLC packs using your score to unlock monsters with higher base health and nastier attacks. This also typically means getting access to new guns from those monsters' drops.
- You can also press the Uninstall DLC button to make all your cool shit (and all the nasty monsters) go poof in a cloud of UNKNA0 sprites. Use as a last resort, because you gotta buy all the DLC again!
- Tap the melee button for a kick. Hold for an EXPLODING kick. If you have the Mega Shield X active, holding the melee button will deactivate it and make the kick explode HARDER.
- Demons drop bits of Health and Armor Essence on kill, which go into your Techno-Flask! Press +USER1 to drink from ye flask when it's built up a full charge of either Health or Armor, restoring 50% health and/or 50% armor. Health and Armor bonuses are replaced with various kinds of Essence Containers, which go right into your Technoflask. Your Technoflask also automatically refills at the start of each level. 
- 100 units of essence turns into 1 charge. However, your Technoflask can keep building up essence after it hits max charges. If you get 100 units of essence while the flask is at max charge, you *upgrade* your flask's charge cap! With the Upgrade Mania Pack, you can also find flask upgrades in the wild, as well as health and armor upgrades.
- With the Rip N Tear Pack, you start getting Ammo Essence from enemies as well, and your Flask gains the ability to grant you 25% ammo for all weapons when you drink it while it has an ammo charge.


## Weapons
All weapons come in Well Done, Medium Rare, Rare, and RAW variants, with each tier being increasingly OP.

### Melee
Aside from your fists, there's a series of melee weapons that improve them. Chainsaw slot. No ammo consumption, obviously.
- Chainsaw (Well Done): The classic. Hits every 3 ticks for 12-18 damage, making it less random than the vanilla chainsaw but technically weaker. Altfire screams and revs the chainsaw, fearing nearby enemies for a bit.
- Sword (Medium Rare): Swings for a nice, consistent 50 damage in a comfortable two-swing pattern. Altfire enables the flame enchantments on the blade and swings, throwing a wave of ripping fire blasts. Unlocked by the Old And New Pack.
- Power Fists (Rare): Big punches for big damage! 30-50 damage with each swing, slightly faster than the sword and without the slight pause afterward. Altfire tases an enemy. Unlocked by the Old And New Pack.
- Giant Drill of Breaking (RAW): Pierce the heavens! Hits every 2 ticks for 15-20 damage, and also applies forward thrust as long as you're on the ground. Altfire plants your feet, drilling without moving. Unlocked by the Anime Reference Pack.

### Pistols
Low DPS. Infinite ammo. Good burst damage, sometimes. Exclusively drops from fodder enemies.
- Stock Pistol (Well Done): 10 rounds rapid, reloads quickly. Does 8-12 damage per shot. Fairly accurate. Altfire is a slower, more controlled shot. Drops from Pistol Zombies, who are unlocked by default.
- Magnum (Medium Rare): Five big shots that eat 2 bullets each. Each shot is actually 2 projectiles, simulating a certain amount of overpenetration if the first shot kills the target; each one does 20-30 damage, so on average a zombieman should die to the first round and the one behind him dies to the second. Highly accurate. Altfire consooms all ammo for one BIG SHOT. Drops from the Magnum Zombie, which is in Zombie Pack 1.
- Dualies (Rare): 30 shots, enough to kill anything that moves! Does 10-15 damage per shot, too, making it more powerful than the stock pistol but less ammo-efficient than the magnum. Altfire performs an invincible dash in your current facing direction. Rare drop from Pistol Zombies with the Rare Drops DLC. Also drops from Dualie Zombies, which are in Zombie Pack 2.
- Beam Pistol (RAW): Somehow converts bullets into laser blasts that rip through enemies. Does not need reloading. Drops from the cyber-troopers in Zombie Pack 3.

### SMGs/ARs
Higher damage than pistols overall, filling a generalist role, but the high mag capacities don't come in until the late tiers. Replaces the Chaingun spawn spot, at least until stuff like the Assault Cannon starts dropping.
- Stock Rifle (Well Done): 25 round mag, reloads almost as fast as the pistol, fires slower than it tho. 16-24 damage per shot; rifles are better than pistols, because they use ammo! It's more accurate than the stock pistol but slightly worse than the magnum. Altfire plays a random "Aim down the sights" voice line. Drops from rifle zombies, who appear in Zombie Pack 1.
- Grenade Rifle (Medium Rare): 20 round mag, reloads as fast as stock rifle, fires slightly faster and does 20-30 damage per shot. Also has an underslung grenade launcher on altfire, which uses...30 bullets??? look, don't ask me. It's otherwise pretty much the Stock Rifle. In fact, it looks suspiciously like a recolored Stock Rifle. Commando Rifle zombies drop this; get them in Zombie Pack 2.
- Demontech Rifle (Rare): 50 round mag! Finally, something that's appropriately-sized for demon killing. Fires...uh...blood. The blood rails pierce all enemies, doing 15-25 damage; great for mowing down crowds. Altfire shoots plasma blasts that deal 30 flat damage but don't pierce, which is ideal for dealing with single targets. Demon Troopers carry these, and are unlocked in Zombie Pack 3.
- Dual SPACEGUNS (RAW): The P90 SPACEGUN is the perfect firearm. What's better than one SPACEGUN? *TWO OF THEM.* Mag size 100 between the two of them, 20-30 damage per shot. No piercing, but they have an *absurd* firerate and tighter spread than the stock rifle. Altfire relaxes your GAMER INSTINCTS, letting the SPACEGUN have a little horizontal spread as a treat, so that you can spread fire out across the room (these shots do 30-35 damage each as a reward for your skillz and aggressive high-risk playstyle). Only dropped by Z-Sec, who are unlocked with the Z-Sec Pack.

### Shotty
The big boomstick. You know what it is. Should be *mostly* usable at range, but will shine in close-quarters combat. Replaces standard shotgun spawn spots.
- Pump Shotgun (Well Done): A steady companion, this thing goes chugga-chugga and chew-chews through zombies with an 8 shell magazine. Fires a tight spread of 7 pellets, each doing 7-15 damage. Altfire pumps the shotgun for emphasis, dropping one shell.
- Double Barrel (Medium-Rare): The great communicator. Fires 21 pellets that do 7-15 damage despite firing only two shells. Altfire magically turns the shells into Dragon's Breath shells by consuming twice as many at once, throwing a spray of ripping fire projectiles that die out after a second or two. Dropped by the Super Shotgun Zombie from Zombie Pack 2.
- Slug Rifle (Rare): Fires 21 pellets doing 7-15 damage, but perfectly accurately. Consooms 2 shells per shot as well. I swear to god this thing's still technically a shotgun even though it's bolt-action. Altfire stuffs an extra shell into the chamber to boost the final damage output. You can do this multiple times, but when you switch away, the shells all burst out of the gun because you can't keep holding them in. Unlocked with the Long-Distance Pack.
- The Ranger (RAW): A seemingly-ordinary double-barreled shotgun that fires 21 pellets that do a consistent 12 damage each...but wait...where's the reload animation? This thing's not a double-barrel, it's a double-barrel AUTOMATIC shotgun! Does not have an altfire because it does not need one. (Pressing altfire goes HUUH instead.) Dropped by the Mystery Ranger, who is added by the Ranger Pack.

### Heavy
Weapons that are big, bad, and don't really fit into the other categories. Replaces super shotgun spawns. Does not need reloading in the usual sense.
- Grenade Launcher (Well Done): Ah, the good ol' M203. Fires...3 shells? Which somehow form into a 40mm grenade. These HE rounds do 40 direct damage plus 128 splash damage in a 128 radius, just like a rocket, but they have gravity. Altfire shoots a timed bouncy grenade instead of an impact grenade--and the bouncy one does 60 impact and 240 splash in that 128 radius, but doesn't detonate on impact with walls.
- Assault Cannon (Medium Rare): A real weird one, this rotary gun apparently chops up shells into individual pellets so it can fire multiple times per shell. Each shot fires 3 pellets that do 10-15 damage each, consuming a shell on every 4th shot. The altfire speeds up your rate of fire, for when you need moar gun. Unlocked with Heavy Weapons Pack.
- Flak Cannon (Rare): This thing is Unreal! Eats 3 shells per shot, launching either a spread of 24 ripper projectiles with primary fire, or a cluster bomb with altfire. The cluster bomb's initial detonation does 80 damage in an 80 radius, and then the 4 mini-bombs it spawns do that again in an X pattern around the point of impact. Unlocked with Heavy Weapons Pack.
- Meteor Gun (RAW): Have you ever fired a railgun that shoots explosions? Shoots a +THRUACTORS projectile that leaves explosives in its wake, dealing massive damage...to smaller targets, since the big ones are immune to radius damage. Also, the explosions don't start for a little bit, so this thing is best used at range. Consumes 3 shells per shot, but has nearly infinite damage potential if you position right. Altfire shoots solid slug shells that don't explode, but do an utterly insane 256 damage to a single target. Unlocked with Big Fraggin Guns Pack.

### Explosive
Weapons that direct-fire rockets and other such things. Separate from Heavy, technically...? Typically don't need reloading, instead having slow firerates. Replaces rocket spawns.
- Rawket Lawnchair (Well Done): Your standard explosive payload launcher. Fires a rocket that does 40 direct and 128 splash in 128 radius. Altfire shoots a "concussion" rocket that does no damage but inflicts knockback, making it ideal for rocketjumping. Also carried by Rocket Zombies from Zombie Pack 2.
- Homing Launcher (Medium Rare): Locks onto targets automatically, but the rockets it fires are lobbed forward before accelerating toward the target. Altfire shoots four rockets at once! Also does 192 splash in a 192 radius. Unlocked in Explosive Weapons Pack.
- Firewall (Rare): Ironically, this launcher won't leave your steak anywhere near rare. Shoots a bouncing fireball in front of you that spreads out over time, ripping through enemies, but it consumes 2 rockets per shot. Altfire shoots an incinerating beam that focuses all that damage in a line. Unlocked in Explosive Weapons Pack.
- Giant Robot's Rocket Rack (RAW): Turns one rocket into a dozen mini homing missiles. The ultimate anti-infantry weapon. Each mini-missile does 20 direct damage and 40 splash damage in an 80 radius (doing max damage out to 40 radius). Unlocked with the Anime Reference Pack.

### Energy
Weapons that shoot zappy things. High accuracy, fixed damage, eats ammo fast. Replaces plasma rifle spawns.
- Plasma Gun (Well Done): Shoots a perfectly accurate stream of blue death. 80 shots in the mag, 32 damage per shot. Altfire shoots a 4-shot spread of green plasma at a slower rate for 40 damage per bolt, not that anybody will notice. Dropped by the Arachnotron and also by Plasma Rifle Zombies in Zombie Pack 1.
- Tech Rifle (Medium Rare): 60-round mag; burst-fires accurate lasers that do 32 damage per shot--but the last shot of the burst also causes a laser blast on impact, for 16 damage (no falloff) in a 128 radius. Altfire fires a Big Laser that leaves the rifle in cooldown for a bit, but does 32 direct damage plus 64 damage (no falloff) in that 128 radius. Patented "Dirty Mag" technology makes spare mags explode when the altfire passes over them! Dropped by Z-Sec from the Z-Sec pack.
- Railgun (Rare): Feeds directly from ammo supply. It's a railgun. Does 150 damage per shot. Primary fire rails. Secondary fire guns. (I will not elaborate.) Added by the Long-Distance Pack. Drops from certain Revenant variants if you've unlocked the Doot Pack.
- Buster (RAW): A powerful energy weapon from an ancient warrior, a true hero who believed that even now there is hope for man. Fires bright-yellow packets of energy that explode on impact, consuming 10 cells at a time and doing 255 damage per shot in a 255-unit radius. Altfire overflows the integer, consuming all of your cell ammo in one glorious beam. Unlocked by the Mega Zandy Pack.

### Super Weapon
Weapons that are omnicidal. Replaces BFG spawns.
- BFG 10K (Well Done): Not the classic you're used to. Consumes 5 cells per shot to rapid-fire 128-splash-damage shots. Altfire shoots a massive ripping Beam Attack that consumes cells extremely rapidly and melts most targets. Drops from certain Spider Mastermind variants if you've unlocked the Boss Rush Pack.
- Davy Crockett (Medium Rare): Is that a fucking nuke? Consumes 10 rockets to fire a single, massive explosive--utterly destroying most targets, and forcing radius damage even on targets that are normally immune. The impact zone becomes radioactive, doing mild damage over time to anybody walking through it and painlocking monsters. Does not need an altfire. (What is wrong with you?) Thank God the Cyberdemons haven't figured out how to use it. (They're too stupid to use a rocket launcher they can self-damage with.) Unlocked with the Nuclear Winter Pack.
- The Right Hand of Benellus (Rare): Blessed by the Shotgod himself, this shotgun crams 20 shells into the same two barrels, firing 216 pellets (108 for each barrel) and doing 15 damage per pellet (because blessed pellets do max damage). Altfire offers a prayer to Benellus, turning all ammo pickups in a 128 unit radius around the player into shells. Unlocked by the Benellus's Grace Pack.
- Miami Sunset (RAW): Wait a second, this is from a different mod! Enormous gatling gun, consuming bullets at insane speeds to create a stream of molten lead that rips through any target. Altfire spins up the gun, alerting and temporarily fearing all monsters on the map; now is coward killing time! Drops from certain Spider Mastermind variants if you've unlocked the Boss Rush Pack. Unlocks with the Miami Sunrise Pack.
